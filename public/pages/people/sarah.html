When Sarah's not out saving the world and kissing babies for press conferences, she is conceptualizing games, characters, and more for Byte Us Gaming! With a bachelor's degree in creative writing and digital humanities, she utilizes her skills in order to make sure the writing aspects and the game design aspects can mesh into one cohesive unit. She is the odd jobber that takes on the random and/or niche challenges presented from art for board games to making sure other team members don't kill each other.
