Tabitha has always been a passionate person, as well as a perfectionist. Since her heart and soul go into everything she does, no task is ever taken lightly. For years she has served as a copyeditor for anyone, from personal friends to Google. She will not rest until every last punctuation mark is appropriately used. Tabitha was introduced into the gaming world by her brothers at a young age. She enjoyed them immensely, despite her familiarity with the game over screen. As a way of quenching her thirst for creativity, she became the Editor and Concept Designer for Byte Us Gaming.
